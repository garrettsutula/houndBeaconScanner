# houndBeaconScanner
an ionic ibeacon scanner using petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon

First cordova/ionic project, screenshot at bottom.

Hound will:
- range beacons with a specific uuid
- keep a running list of beacons spotted
- pause/resume & clear beacon list

To-do:
- add settings page to configure ranging (major, minor, uuid, identifier)
- devise some basic metadata service to call to get other beacon metadata (e.g. loc, assets, etc.)
